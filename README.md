## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to `SiliconGenesis`! This repository is my digital logbook for the 20-week **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, a landmark initiative by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**. My goal is to document every step of this "Concept to Silicon" journey, from initial setup to the final tapeout.

This is more than just a course; it's a contribution to India's semiconductor mission 🇮🇳.
