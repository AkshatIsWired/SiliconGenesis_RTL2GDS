# SiliconGenesis_RTL2GDS
This repository chronicles my dedicated journey learning the Digital ASIC Design Flow from start to finish, leveraging the power of fully open-source EDA tools and Process Design Kits (PDKs).  The primary objective is to create a robust, end-to-end log detailing every step from the initial RTL (Register Transfer Level) code down to the GDS Layout.
