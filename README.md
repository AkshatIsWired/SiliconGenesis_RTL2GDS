## üìñ About This Repository

Welcome to `SiliconGenesis`! This repository is my digital logbook for the 20-week **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, a landmark initiative by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**. My goal is to document every step of this "Concept to Silicon" journey, from initial setup to the final tapeout, as a contribution to India's growing semiconductor mission üáÆüá≥.

## üõ†Ô∏è Open-Source EDA Toolchain

We are using a powerful suite of open-source tools to navigate the entire VLSI design flow. Each tool has a specific role in turning our digital logic into a physical reality.

| Stage in Flow             | Tool Name                                       | Purpose                                            |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simulation** |           `Icarus Verilog` & `GTKWave`                     | To simulate and visualize our Verilog code's behavior. |
| **Synthesis** |            `Yosys`                                          | To translate our RTL code into a gate-level netlist.   |
| **Physical Design** |       `Magic`                                        | For editing and analyzing the physical VLSI layout.    |
| **Automated Flow** |       `OpenLane`                                       | An automated flow that handles the entire RTL to GDSII process.   |
| **Circuit Simulation** |    `ngspice`                                       | For post-layout analog and mixed-signal simulation.       |
